One day I decided that I really wanted to download a ton of PDF's for old things I used like. And I discovered that there were sources for these things. So I wrote a quick script to hog them down so I wouldn't have to use some janky browser plugin or do lots of clicking.

At the moment, this takes a single argument-a web page to scrape for PDF links. It does some manipulation of the filename to avoid spaces and reserved characters.

There is certainly lots of room for improvement, which may occur if I need to use it again and it doesn't meet my needs!
